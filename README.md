# **Guilty Gear Strive Combat System**

> **Note**: The A.I. is dumb and won't put everything needed in a readme in this file. It's not my fault.

A simple text-based fighting game inspired by the popular *Guilty Gear Strive* franchise. In this game, you control one of the iconic characters and engage in turn-based combat against a CPU opponent. The game features combo-based attacks, special moves, shields, and more!

> **Note**: This game is made fully by A.I. and it does not work well at all, but it was fun making this. Enjoy!

In *Guilty Gear Strive Combat System*, you pick a fighter and face off against a randomly selected CPU opponent. The goal is to defeat the opponent by strategically using attacks, special moves, shields, and combos.

### **Core Features:**

- **Special moves**: Each character has a unique special move with cooldowns.
- **Shields**: Use shields to reduce incoming damage.
- **Grab attacks**: A powerful attack that bypasses shields but deals reduced damage.
- **Randomized opponents**: Fight against different characters with varying strength, agility, and health.

## **Gameplay Mechanics**

1. **Turn-based Combat**:  
   The game alternates between your turn and the CPU's turn. Both players choose an action (e.g., Attack, Shield, Special Move) in each round.

2. **Combo Sequences**:  
   For each attack, you may be prompted to enter a combination of `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys in a time-limited window. Completing the combo gives you a damage multiplier (up to 1.2x) for your attack.

3. **Shields**:  
   Activating a shield reduces the damage taken during the opponent's turn. Shield effectiveness is capped at 20% of incoming damage.

4. **Special Moves**:  
   Each character has a unique special move, dealing extra damage. Special moves can only be used after a cooldown period.

5. **Grab**:  
   Grabs bypass shields and deal reduced damage (40% of your strength).
